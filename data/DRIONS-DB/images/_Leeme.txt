ABOUT THE IMAGES DATA BASE
==========================
 
The 110 images were acquired with a colour analogical fundus camera, approximately
centred on the ONH and they were stored in slide format. In order to have the images 
in digital format, they were digitised using a HP-PhotoSmart-S20 high-resolution 
scanner, RGB format, resolution 600x400 and 8 bits/pixel.
